# STA 323 / 523 :: Project

## Introduction

The Census Bureau’s mission is to serve as the nation’s leading provider
of quality data about its people and economy. This year is a census
year, and data on every person living in the United States and its five
territories will be collected. The data and analysis that follows will
be used to decide how to allocate federal funds, determine Congressional
seats, and to provide [Age
Search](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/agesearch.html)
information.

In this project you will use data of your choice from the Census Bureau
and develop a Shiny app that will analyze, model, or communicate aspects
of the data to app users.

## Data resources

-   [Data exploration](https://www.census.gov/data.html): resources and
    articles for inspiration as to what you want to do in this project

-   [Datasets](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets.html): searchable
    datasets provided by the Census Bureau

-   [Tables](https://www.census.gov/data/tables.html): searchable tables
    provided by the Census Bureau

-   [API](https://www.census.gov/developers/): API documentation

## Project requirements

1.  Your project must be reproducible.

2.  Your project must involve some aspect of statistics.

3.  Your project must include some aspect of R or statistical computing
    beyond what was introduced in this course. For example, this can be
    an extension of some topic or a new package.

## Tasks

#### Task 1

Select a subset of the Census Bureau data to work with for this project.
Choose a dataset that interests you. As long as the data comes from the
primary domain of `www.census.gov`, then it is permitted. The data may
be accessed via their API or one of the various file formats provided
(XLS, CSV, JSON, Shp, PDF). You may supplement your Census data
selection with outside data from any source; however, this is not a
requirement.

#### Task 2

Use your selected data to create a Shiny app or dashboard that allows
users to interact, explore, and better understand the data. You may want
to work with the [Navigation Bar
Page](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/navbar-example.html) layout or
[Shiny Dashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/). Both
options will neatly structure your app’s user interface; however, these
are not the only options.

**Required app features**:

1.  An information section - what is the data, where did it come from,
    what is the purpose. Make it clear to users what data they are
    exploring.

2.  It should have at least three different input/control widgets.

3.  It should have at least three different output displays.

4.  It should incorporate at least one derivative shiny package such as
    `shinythemes` or `shinyalert`. There are many more, these are just
    two examples.

5.  It should be well organized and aesthetically pleasing.

Check out [Shiny’s gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) for
inspiration.

#### Task 3

Publish your app on
[https://www.shinyapps.io/](https://www.shinyapps.io/).

#### Task 4

Edit this README file.

1.  Change the title from `STA 323 / 523 :: Project` to something more
    meaningful as it relates to your app.

2.  Remove all other text.

3.  Include “Introduction” and “References” sections, and add any other
    relevant information to this README that someone looking at your
    repo may be interested in knowing. This can be text explaining your
    data and app or images of your app giving readers a preview.

4.  Add a link to your app that you published in Task 3.

## Essential details

#### Deadline and submission

<b>The deadline to submit your project is 11:59am Eastern Standard Time
on Wednesday, June 24.</b>

#### git/GitHub

Only your final commit and code in the master branch will be graded. Do
not forget to push your complete work to your assigned repository on
GitHub before the deadline.

#### Help

-   Post your questions in the #project channel on Slack. Explain your
    error / problem in as much detail as possible or give a reproducible
    example that generates the same error. Make use of the code snippet
    option available in Slack.

-   Visit the instructor or TAs in Zoom office hours.

#### Academic integrity

This is an individual assignment. You should not communicate with other
students. As a reminder, any code you use directly or as inspiration
must be cited.
